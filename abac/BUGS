Partial proof returns entire graph
    When a query fails libabac returns a partial proof, which is to say
    a set of credentials it knows about that it thinks are relevant to
    the proof.

    Currently, when a query fails libabac returns all the credentials it
    knows about.

    In a proper implementation, the set of credentials returned will
    only be those that are reachable from the principal and those that
    have a path to the role in question.
