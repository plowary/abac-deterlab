#
# The example makes use of 2 principals, Acme and Coyote.
#
# This example shows a very simple delegation of roles by Acme.  Acme's
# buy_rockets role includes all of Acme's preferred customers.  The setup.py
# creates the principals and the attr.py creates 2 policy credentials.  
# Credential 1 encodes the policy that all of Acme's preferred customers 
# can buy rockets from Acme and
# Credential 2 defines the Coyote as an Acme preferred customer.

# The ./run_query script issues queries to show that the Coyote is both a preferred
# customer and can buy rockets.  Two invalid queries are also made, checking if
# Acme is the Coyote's friend, which it isn't and whether a query about
# something other than a principal works (it doesn't).

# acme_rockets_rt0

# Credential 1
#[keyid:Acme].role:buy_rockets <- [keyid:Acme].role:preferred_customer 

# Credential 2
#[keyid:Acme].role:preferred_customer <- [keyid:Coyote]
