   To demostrate scalability of libabac and to get a rough 
performance data, 2 types of scaling tests are designed.

   haytack is the noise injection test 
   daisychain is the long chaining proof test

   To run,
 
     make runcheck


   will run several sets of setup/query that are of different
sizes on each type of test

   2 subdirectories are setup to make timing runs and generate
jpeg graphs.
   (Note, currently the Makefile for plotting is base for 
   gnu make and so it is not going to work right with FreeBSD's 
   make)

   haystack/fruit_python
   daisychain/likes_python

   To run,

      make plot
