A libabac keystore is a simple directory filled with some number of X509
identity and XML attribute certificates. It may optionally include RSA
private keys.

X509 identity certs are identified as files whose names end in _ID.der
or _ID.pem. The part before the _ID.pem is irrelevant, though for the
sake of convneince the libabac credential manager gives it the name of
the CN you supplied.

XML attribute certs are identified as files whose names end in
_attr.xml. The portion before the _attr.xml is irrelevant.
