Role names in ABAC are allowed to contain the following sets of characters:

    A-Z
    a-z
    0-9
    -       [hyphen]
    _       [underscore]

A role name must begin with a letter or digit (A-z, a-z, 0-9).

There is no limit on the length of a role name.

As a technicality, creddy requires the CN to also meet these rules. Both ABAC
and creddy will handle certificates with CNs that do not meet this criteria.
