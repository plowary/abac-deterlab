OVERVIEW

ABAC proves attributes about principals.

libabac is comprised of three main types of objects: credentials, roles,
and contexts.

A typical use of ABAC is:

    - create a context
    - load some certificates
    - clone the context
    - add more certificates, possibly presented by another party
    - make a query 'does principal B have the role A.r1?'

CREDENTIAL

An ABAC credential is the most basic unit of an ABAC proof. It is a
signed assertion by a principal A that some other entity has a role r1.
Abstractly, it is one of the following (A and B principls, r1, r2, r3
roles):

    A.r1 <- B
    A.r1 <- B.r2
    A.r1 <- B.r2.r3

When interacting with libabac, a credential is represented by an X509
attribute certificates and the associated issuer X509 identity
certificate.

A principal is represented by the SHA1 hash of the public key of its
identity certificate. Therefore when a credential is encoded in an
attribute certificate, it will look something along the lines of:

    e65aace9237833ec775253cfde97f59a0af5bc3d.frobnicate <-
        e93547826455a80d9488825a1d083ef6ef264107

ROLE

ABAC roles are the atomic units that form the head and tail of a
credential. The head will always be a proper role, which is to say it
takes form:

    A.r1

As seen in the CREDENTIAL section, the tail of a role can take one of
three forms:

    principal:      B
    role:           B.r2
    linking role:   B.r2.r3

For more information about the different types of roles, refer to
[Li03rt].

CONTEXT

An ABAC context object encapsulates a set of ABAC credentials and its
associated proof graph. The context supports the following operations:

    - load X509 identity certificate
    - load X509 attribute certificate
    - list all the credentials (attribute identity certificate pairs)
    - query whether a principal has a given role
    - duplicate context
